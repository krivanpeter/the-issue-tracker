# The Unicorn Attractor

I'm a student at Code Institute and I've reached my fifth milestone project which was to create this webapplication.
I needed to use all of my knowledge I got through the course.

## What does it do?

This website is made for users who use a given software.
The users can read the news, report bugs and "buy" new features.

They can upvote bugs and features so the developer team will know that to do first.
Users can speak to each other via comments under every piece of news, bugs or features.

## How does it work?

This website uses Django and AJAX to route viewers through the site.
The animations are created with JQuery.
The site is styled with Bootstrap.
The site can be viewed [HERE](#) later.

## User Stories
1. As a user on the website I want to be able to see the latest news,
so that I may immediately know about new features or fixed bugs.

2. NEED TO BE FILLED
